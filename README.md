How do I get started?
Where can I get more help, if I need it?**
To get started you could launch the source code directly via jupyter notebook. You could use mercury to launch on via the browser or launch it on premise from a local machine. The DevTool uses tensorflow model trained by Askar Aituov on a number of low quality and high quality software requirements specifications, user stories and system design diagrams.
